The theatre was placed beside it so the kids can play whilst waiting for the event to happen or easily accessible for a parent to have to escape to the playground to placate a crying child who won't sit through the performance. The other key pod is the excercise are and sports court. Surrounding the entire space are trees, seating and pavillons for people to watch, rest or chat whilst friends are playing in the court.
